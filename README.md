# Project Name:  IDC_detection_Breast_Cancer
 
Research Summary:

This research introduces a novel approach for the automated detection of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in breast cancer histopathology images using a Deep Learning Ensemble framework. The proposed model incorporates four distinct architectures, including pre-trained models (DenseNet, VGG16, ShuffleNet V2) and a custom CNN. The ensemble model exhibits superior performance, achieving a balanced accuracy of 96.16%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.923, and a kappa score of 0.9231.

The study addresses the challenging task of IDC detection, emphasizing the efficacy of deep learning in medical image analysis. By leveraging a large dataset of 160,000 images and employing Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for computational acceleration, the research highlights the significance of efficiency in processing.

Comprehensive evaluations using various metrics underscore the proposed model's effectiveness in distinguishing IDC from normal patches. The results signify promising advancements in the application of Deep Ensemble Networks for breast cancer pathology analysis. The paper encourages further exploration in this domain, underscoring the potential of deep learning models in predicting ground truth for enhanced diagnostic assistance.
